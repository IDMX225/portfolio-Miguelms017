Here I'm showing another project that shows a complete essay about non-profit organizations across America by using HTML ans SASS.

In this project, It is used several SASS instances incluided the application of color palettes and the use of customized variables that allows a perfect edition of this page.

The use of mixins are visible inside the code. that is because there are more mixins added in order to improve the structure of the page.

Another Plus on this project is the use of a link that downloads a rough draft of the essay.
